## Installation

To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, please ensure that you add the following lines to your ansible.cfg file.

```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```
The token can be obtained from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

Once the above steps are done, you can run the following command to install the collection.

```
ansible-galaxy collection install cloud.gcp_ops
```

## Use Case

Once installed, you can reference the cloud.gcp_ops collection content by its fully qualified collection name (FQCN), for example:

```yaml

  # Create GCP custom machine image.
  - hosts: all
    vars:
        project: "{{ gcp_project }}"
        auth_kind: "{{ gcp_cred_kind }}"
        service_account_file: "{{ gcp_cred_file }}"
    tasks:
      - name: Create a new custom machine image
        ansible.builtin.include_role:
            name: cloud.gcp_ops.manage_machine_image
        vars:
            manage_machine_image_operation: create
            manage_machine_image_source_disk_name: "{{ disk_name }}"
            manage_machine_image_image_name: "{{ image_name }}"
            manage_machine_image_image_description: "{{ description }}"


  # clone an existing on prem VM using the KVM hypervisor.
  - hosts: kvm
    tasks:
      - name: Import 'cloud.gcp_ops.clone_on_prem_vm' role
        ansible.builtin.include_role:
          name: cloud.gcp_ops.clone_on_prem_vm
        vars:
          clone_on_prem_vm_source_vm_name: "{{ clone_on_prem_vm_source_vm_name }}"
          clone_on_prem_vm_image_name: "{{ clone_on_prem_vm_image_name }}"
          clone_on_prem_vm_local_image_path: "{{ clone_on_prem_vm_local_image_path }}"
          clone_on_prem_vm_uri: "{{ clone_on_prem_vm_uri }}"
```

## Contributing to this collection

We welcome community contributions to this collection. If you find problems, please open an issue or create a PR against this collection repository.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.gcp_ops/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Testing

The project uses `ansible-lint` and `black`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/cloud/gcp_ops/`, run:

```shell
  tox -e linters
```

Sanity and unit tests are run as normal:

```shell
  ansible-test sanity
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests require GCP credentials that must be provided to ansible-test. To authenticate using service account credentials:

1. [Create a service account key](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en&ref_topic=6262490#serviceaccounts&zippy=%2Cservice-accounts) in the GCP console and save the json cred file.

2. Create the file `tests/integration/cloud-config-gcp.ini` containing the following:

   ```ini
    [default]
    gcp_project: <project ID>
    gcp_cred_file: </path/to/cred/file.json>
    gcp_cred_kind: serviceaccount
   ```

To authenticate with [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) via the [GCloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install):

1. Once you have installed `gcloud` and performed basic initialization (via `gcloud init`) run:

   ```shell
    gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

2. Create the file `tests/integration/cloud-config-gcp.ini` containing the following:

   ```ini
    [default]
    gcp_project: <project ID>
    gcp_cred_kind: application
   ```

Once credentials are set up, run all integration tests with `ansible-test integration` or run a subset of integration tests with `ansible-test integration <target>`

This collection is tested using GitHub Actions. To know more about CI, refer to [CI.md](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.gcp_ops/blob/main/CI.md).
